# Decision tree using Python
Decision tree is one of the most popular algorithm of Machine Learning.
A Decision Tree is a flowchart like structure, where each node represents a decision, each branch represents an outcome of the decision, and each terminal node provides a prediction / label.
# Why learn about Decision Trees?
- Decision Trees are the most widely and commonly used machine learning algorithms.
- Decision Trees can be used for solving both classification as well as regression problems.
- Decision Trees are robust to Outliers, so if you have Outliers in your data - you can still build Decision Tree models without worrying about impact of Outliers on your model.
- Decision Trees are easy to interpret and hence have multiple applications in different industries.
# What do I need to start with Decision Tree course?
- A working laptop / desktop with 4 GB RAM
- A working Internet connection
- Basic knowledge of Machine Learning
- Basic knowledge of Python - check out this Course first, if you are new to Python
This is all it takes for you to learn one of the most powerful algorithm in Machine Learning.
